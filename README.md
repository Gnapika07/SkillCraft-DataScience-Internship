##  Task 01: Data Visualization (Bar Chart / Histogram)

###  Objective
Visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using a bar chart or histogram.  
For this task, we visualize **India's population distribution by age group (2022).**

---

###  Dataset
| Age Group   | Population (Millions) | Percentage |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 0–20 Years   | 512                  | 36.1%       |
| 21–64 Years  | 807                  | 57.0%       |
| 65+ Years    | 98                   | 6.9%        |

---

###  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- NumPy

---

###  Visualizations
1. **Bar Chart** – Displays total population in each age group  
2. **Histogram** – Shows distribution of ages (sample continuous data)

---

###  Output Summary
- Successfully visualized categorical and continuous data distributions  
- Bar chart shows clear comparison between age groups  
- Histogram shows how ages are distributed across the population

# Task 02: Titanic Dataset Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology.

## Steps Performed
1. Data Loading  
2. Data Cleaning  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Visualization of Survival Trends  
5. Summary of Findings

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Dataset
Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate.
- First-class passengers had better chances.
- Younger people survived more often.
