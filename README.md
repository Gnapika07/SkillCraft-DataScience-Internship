## 📊 Task 01: Data Visualization (Bar Chart / Histogram)

### 🎯 Objective
Visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using a bar chart or histogram.  
For this task, we visualize **India's population distribution by age group (2022).**

---

### 🧠 Dataset
| Age Group   | Population (Millions) | Percentage |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 0–20 Years   | 512                  | 36.1%       |
| 21–64 Years  | 807                  | 57.0%       |
| 65+ Years    | 98                   | 6.9%        |
